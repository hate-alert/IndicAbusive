***StandAloneTraining.py***
------------------------------------------
This file has been used to train models separately for all the languages. You have to specify the proper dataset path to load the datasets.

------------------------------------------
***JointTrainingAllLanaugesData.py***
------------------------------------------
This file has been used to train models jointly for all the languages. The code is almost similar to StandAloneTraining.py.

------------------------------------------
***ModelTransferZero-shot.py***
------------------------------------------
This file has been used to evaluate the models' zero-shot performance. Here the previously fine-tuned models have been used for the purpose.

------------------------------------------
***ModelTransferFew-shot.py***
------------------------------------------
This file has been used to perform few-shot training. Here the previously fine-tuned models have been used for the purpose.
